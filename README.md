# Domain Driven Design Core Helpers

Domain Driven Design Core Helpers is a lightweight helper library for implementing **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** in .NET applications.  
It provides abstract base classes for common building blocks such as **Value Objects** and **Entities**, along with a simple **Result** type to standardize success/failure handling.

## ✨ Features

- 🔹 Abstract **ValueObject** base class with equality and immutability support.
- 🔹 **Result** class for clean success/failure operations without exceptions.
- 🔹 Designed for **.NET 9.0+** and modern C#.
